micro:games is a simple game hub for the micro:bit. Built with [MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) and [MicroPython](https://python.microbit.org/).

## How to Play

* ### microINVADERS
> Tilt the micro:bit left or right to move the ship, and press B to shoot the enemies. Enemies come in waves of 7, each with more health than the one before.

* ### microDODGE
> Dodge obstacles from ahead by using A and B to move left and right. Obstacles spawn and come faster as time moves on.

* ### microRACE
> Pick the number of total clicks required to win using A and B, then spam A and B to get to the end and "*win the race*". You are timed on how long you take.

# Usage

To use this repo, get the latest [release](https://github.com/orn8/micro-games/releases) of the `Source code` and unarchive it, then go to the `hex` folder and load in any game you like.
